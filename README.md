# SentiMeld: Advanced Sentiment Analysis Platform

An innovative sentiment analysis tool that combines multiple NLP approaches to provide comprehensive sentiment insights from text data.

## Features

- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines traditional ML (NLTK), deep learning (Transformers), and rule-based methods for robust sentiment analysis
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Goes beyond positive/negative classification to detect emotions, intensity, and aspect-based sentiments
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore sentiment patterns with dynamic dashboards
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Easily adapt to different domains (tweets, product reviews, etc.)
- **Explainable Results**: Understand what drives sentiment scores with feature importance and attention visualization
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other applications

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download required NLTK data:
   ```
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('wordnet')"
   ```
4. Download SpaCy model:
   ```
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

### Usage

#### Training Models

```python
python main.py --mode train --data path/to/data --model ensemble
```

#### Analyzing Text

```python
python main.py --mode analyze --text "This product is amazing! Highly recommended."
```

#### Running the Dashboard

```python
python visualization/dashboard.py
```

## What Makes SentiMeld Different?

1. **Ensemble Architecture**: Unlike most sentiment tools that rely on a single approach, SentiMeld combines multiple methods for more accurate results.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Uses transformer models to capture context and nuance in language.
3. **Aspect-Based Analysis**: Identifies specific aspects being discussed and their associated sentiments.
4. **Emotion Detection**: Goes beyond positive/negative to detect specific emotions (joy, anger, surprise, etc.).
5. **Interactive Exploration**: Provides tools to explore and understand sentiment patterns in your data.
6. **Customizable Pipeline**: Easily adapt to different domains with transfer learning.


## Project Structure

The project is now properly organized with:

- A dedicated dataset directory containing the IMDB Dataset
- Proper path handling in all modules
- Consistent directory structure
The SentiMeld project combines multiple approaches to sentiment analysis, including traditional machine learning models, transformer-based models, and ensemble methods, providing a comprehensive solution for sentiment analysis tasks.
